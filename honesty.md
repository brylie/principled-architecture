# Honesty

Being honest means we do our best to communicate the plain truth. We can be in conversation, sending an email, or committing code, but in each case we should strive to be honest about our intentions.

## Openness

Openness means opening up whata might otherwise be inaccessible to others. Whether it is opening up through communication, providing access to the inner workings of our software, or allowing outside persons to participate freely in our community, we can strive to be open when possible.

## Clarity

Clarity is the light that evaporates the mists of confusion and doubt. We can be clear about our goals and intentions, as well as communicating as clearly as possible to those around us. This extends to how we plan and manage our projects as well as how we write source code.
