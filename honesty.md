# Honesty

Being honest means we do our best to communicate the plain truth. We can be in conversation, sending an email, or committing code, but in each case we should strive to be honest about our intentions.

## Openness

Openness means opening up whata might otherwise be inaccessible to others. Whether it is opening up through communication, providing access to the inner workings of our software, or allowing outside persons to participate freely in our community, we can strive to be open when possible.

## Clarity
