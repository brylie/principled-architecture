# Cleanliness

Cleanliness is a committment to living in harmony and good order. In plain terms, it means leaving things better than how we found them.

## Organization

An important part of keeping things in good order is to be organized. Organization can be done on small or large scales, from a single resource to an entire community. It is important to make sure everyone involved in a project or community has a shared understanding of how things are organized.
