Simplicity is a commitmitment to 'just enough'. By practicing simplicity, we build only what is needed, and maintain only what is useful. We challenge each idea before committing to the work, descerning whether something we want but don't truly need.

## Cleanliness

Cleanliness is a committment to living in harmony and good order. In plain terms, it means leaving things better than how we found them.

## Organization

An important part of keeping things in good order is to be organized. Organization can be done on small or large scales, from a single resource to an entire community. It is important to make sure everyone involved in a project or community has a shared understanding of how things are organized.

## Honesty

Being honest means we do our best to communicate the plain truth. We can be in conversation, sending an email, or committing code, but in each case we should strive to be honest about our intentions.

## Openness

Openness means opening up whata might otherwise be inaccessible to others. Whether it is opening up through communication, providing access to the inner workings of our software, or allowing outside persons to participate freely in our community, we can strive to be open when possible.

## Clarity

Clarity is the light that evaporates the mists of confusion and doubt. We can be clear about our goals and intentions, as well as communicating as clearly as possible to those around us. This extends to how we plan and manage our projects as well as how we write source code.

## Consistency

Consistency helps us find familiarity in a changing environment. We learn patterns of action and design, and can recognize or reproduce those patterns with increasing ease.

## Community

We live in an interconnected web of life. As such, community has played a critical role in our evolution as a species. We need community to thrive and transcent our capabilities as individuals. As software developers, it is important we emerse ourselves in communities of practice, to improve our skills and commonwealth.

## Diversity

Diversity is welcoming of various qualities and viewpoints. We realize there is no 'one size fits all'. What is right for one person, project, organization, or community may not be 'the right fit' elsewhere.

## Inclusion

## Communication

## Stewardship

## Conservation

## Build on the past

## Purpose

## Focus

## Vision

## Attainment
