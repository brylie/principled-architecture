## A Tale of Two Houses

Imagine building a house. There are a lot of decisions and steps along the way. We can use guidelines, or principles, to help us make decisions and work effectively. Lets consider two imaginary houses, where the developers apply differing principles.

The first house, we'll call the 'ticky-tacky' house. The developer of the 'ticky-tacky' house wants first and foremost to build cheaply, so they can build as many houses as possible. They source cheap materials, labor, and a large tract of land sold at auciton. The 'ticky-tacky' developer uses a generic template to build the house, nearly identical to other houses in the neigborhood. The 'ticky-tacky' house is build to last around 30-40 years before significant repairs are needed, or otherwise the house should be demolished and built anew.
